\section{Description of the Dataset}

This dataset is obtained from Kaggle. With installs as the dependent variable. For regression model, a numerical value column, \texttt{installCount}, is selected as target, while for classification, the dataset is transformed into binary classification based on the installs.

The mobile application development is a hot area for software engineering. Individual developers are the backbone of this industry. However, some developers do not know exactly which kinds of apps are popular. They struggle to set price of their apps or make decisions on whether to include In App Purchases. This dataset can provide insights on all the issues and be used to predict installs for developers before they delve into development.
