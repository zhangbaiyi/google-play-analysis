\section{Abstract}

Mobile apps are a heated area in app development. It is beneficial for developer community to statistically analyze the existing apps of the market. The project aims to predict the number of an app's install based on the features like rating and category. For pre-prococessing and EDA, PCA and normal tests based on \texttt{scikit-learn} and \texttt{seaborn} library are applied to the app dataset.
For regression, the project tries to make use of \texttt{statsmodel} library to estimate a linear regression model by means of t-test, f-test, AIC, BIC and other properties like MSE. 

Decision tree, KNN, SVM and Na\"ive Bayes algorithms are applied in grid search to achieve hyper parameter in classifier model training. Ensemble learning and neural network classifiers are also compared. Based on the metrics including precision, recall, specificity, F score and AUC generated by a pipeline, the best estimator for classification is Neural Network Classifiers.

The project provides many approaches to application of machine learning algorithms in the industry. Future work should focus on data pre-processing, result visualizing, theoretical analyzing of the parameters of classifiers, pipeline programming and performance improving.
